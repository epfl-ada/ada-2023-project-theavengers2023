Our mission, should we decide to accept it (we do), takes you on a journey where we dissect connections between actors. Discover how these links influence financial success and film quality, while exploring aspects such as geography, timeline, and film genre. Thus, no more sterile debates about actor ensembles and dive into the data for an in-depth understanding of the seventh art. Get ready for an unprecedented cinematic adventure where the facts speak for themselves!

## Research Questions
Our approach aims to highlight redundant connections among certain actors and assess their financial and qualitative impact on films. This will enable film producers to make strategic decisions and, on the other hand, provide you with the necessary arguments to win your debates with cinephile friends

- Does the rise of the number of famous actors has a significant impact on the revenue and the quality of a movie ?
- Which actor pairs have the best and worst chimistry ?
- Can we characterize the interconnetions between the actors ?
- Vis-a-vis to the previous questions, do we observe different conclusion in function of the geography, timeline, or film gender ?

## Aditional Datasets
The Movies Dataset on Kaggle : \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data}
This data is useful to enhance the revenues of the dataset. It contains information about 45'000 movies. Therefore, merging this dataset to the original dataset increases the number of value for the column "Revenu" by 19%. This is a significately improvement and justify the utilisation of this additional dataset. 

Translation wikiID-IMDID :
The first additional dataset we wanted to add has the weakness to not use wikipediaID but IMDID. Therefore, we use a additional dataset to be able to merge the original dataframe with the first additional.
