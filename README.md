Title

Abstract: A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?

Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.
- Does the addition of known actors increase a film's revenue? if yes, what is the relationship between the number of famous actor and the revenues.

- Which actor pairs significantly elevate movie revenues beyond the benchmark?

-  Gender and actor pairs.




Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.

The Movies Dataset on Kaggle : \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data}
This data is useful to enhance the revenues of the dataset. It contains information about 45'000 movies. Therefore, merging this dataset to the original dataset increases the number of value for the column "Revenu" by 19%. This is a significately improvement and justify the utilisation of this additional dataset. 

Translation wikiID-IMDID :
The first additional dataset we wanted to add has the weakness to not use wikipediaID but IMDID. Therefore, we use a additional dataset to be able to merge the original dataframe with the first additional.
