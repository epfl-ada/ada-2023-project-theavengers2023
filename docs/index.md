### Money Talks, But Let's Keep It Real
When we talk box office hits, we gotta make sure we're not comparing the '20s silent flicks to today's 3D extravaganzas without some tweaks. Money's worth more or less depending on when you're spending it, right? That's why we adjust the cash flow from back in the day to match today's dollars. It's like giving old movies a fair fight in today's box office arena.

Take a peek at this chart right here. Once we adjust for inflation, the old correlation between a movie's release year and its wallet—both what it cost and what it made—kinda fades away. But here's a kicker: the relationship between what a film spends and earns? Still cozy. The more a movie's budget balloons, the more it seems to rake in. Looks like spending big could mean earning big, but let's not forget—correlation isn't causation. So, let's not jump to conclusions just yet!
